                <h2><span>Bio</span></h2>
                <p>Tando Mjekula
                    a university student
                    I am the founder and director of 400 Energy, a solar solution provider.
                    My goal is to become skilled enough to create large projects on my own, and upskill and better myself as much as possible.
                    I have successfully run a solar company leading to the companyâ€™s increased market share. I have pitched business ideas in front of many start-up accelerators and venture capitalists and even secured funding. This allowed me to cultivate a reputation as a young man in a professional enviroment.
                    </p>
                <h2><span>Elevator Pitch</span></h2>
                <p>
                    I am a dynamic director who oversees every facet of 400 Energy (a solar and backup solution provider), however, my expertise lies within the technical understanding of the designs of solar projects as well as my coding skills. My understanding of software engineering and the technicalities of solar have come from my experience, diligence and time spent understanding systems. Combining my knowledge and skills with strong project management and decision-making skills, I have successfully created and run a company from inception to its current position.  

                    As an aspiring software engineer, I have honed my skills through ALX, creating portfolio projects and coding for 400 Energy. Throughout the process, I have honed my skills in C, HTML, CSS, and other skills within the information technology space, such as Git, Linux, and overall object-orientated coding.
                   
                    During my tenure, I learned how to execute business plans to maximize profitability, streamline operations and maintain compliance with industry regulations. I am a detail-orientated team player with strong organizational skills and with ability to handle multiple projects simultaneously with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
